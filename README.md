## General innfo

The full stack application called PostIt, that allows you to share a message with the world. You can login with Gmail and post your thoughts. The app allows you to add post or delete it and also add comments to your and other people posts.

-   React
-   Next.js 13 - next auth and auth users
-   Tailwaind css

-   Tanstack-query (react-query)
